title: Raspberry Flavoured - Server Pack Installation
hide_meta: true
---

The server pack will stay updated to the latest version of Raspberry Flavoured. Currently, the server pack is for 3.0-pre2.

If you are using a hosting provider, you'll need to run everything locally, zip the results, and upload them via FTP/SFTP.

1. Create a directory for your server. This should be different than your Minecraft folder.
1. Download my [server pack](https://asphodel.cc/resources/cf/Raspberry-Flavoured-3.0-pre2-Server-Pack.zip) and extract it to this server directory.
5. Run `update.sh` (Linux, MacOS) or `update.bat` (Windows) to download the modpack files and install Forge.
6. Run `run.sh` (Linux, MacOS) or `run.bat` (Windows) to start the server.
7. Connect like normal!

If you ever need to update the pack, just repeat the process by running `update.sh` or `update.bat` again.
